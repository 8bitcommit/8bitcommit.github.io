Iâ€™m a Dad, Husband, guitarist, and tech guy who cares about privacy, clean systems, and good sound. I use Linux, play a lot of guitar, and spend my time thinking about how technology shapes our lives. Aux Send is where I write about music, code, and whatever else is running through the mix.

### My story

But I'll get to it!
