subtitle: Who am I?
---  

I’m a dad, guitarist, and tech guy who cares about privacy, secure systems, and interesting sounds. I love music and spend my time thinking about how technology shapes our lives. **Aux Send** is where I write about music, code, and whatever else is running through the mix.

### My story

I'm a versatile IT professional with hands-on experience across both physical and digital systems. I began my career as an Electrician in 2012 and transitioned into data and networking roles in 2017, where I built a strong foundation in infrastructure management and troubleshooting. In 2021, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Systems and Information Security, further fueling my interest in automation, embedded systems, and secure network design.

With a background that bridges field-level electrical work and advanced IT/security skills, I specialize in designing and securing complex systems. I'm especially passionate about using automation to streamline and protect digital environments.

When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me playing my Epiphone EJ-200 or Fender Stratocaster guitars, or out running trails with my Brittany dog, Layla, who insists on keeping me outdoors. Some of my favorite moments happen around a campfire.
