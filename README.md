# Aux Send

**A signal chain of security, software, and sound.**  
A blog by Adam Kearsey — systems thinker, network wrangler, and audio-obsessed technologist.

## 🔍 What is this?

Aux Send is a personal blog that explores the intersection of technology, infrastructure, digital security, and creative life.  
It’s a mix of technical projects, cultural commentary, and curiosity-driven experiments — routed through one mind and a few too many cables.

If you're into:

- 🛠️ Practical security tools and network forensics  
- 🔌 Infrastructure commentary from an ex-electrician turned infosec guy  
- 📦 DIY Linux environments (like [PhantomDrive](https://adamkearsey.com/2025/01/02/PhantomDrive.html))  
- 🤖 Thoughts on AI, ethics, and digital autonomy  
- 🎸 Sound design, guitar gear, and the weird poetry of systems

…then you’re in the right place.
