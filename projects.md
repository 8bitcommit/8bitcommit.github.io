Hey, check out my [GitHub!](https://github.com/8bitcommit)

Heres what I've been working on:

[PhantomDrive](https://github.com/8bitcommit)  provides solution to the [Evil Maid attack.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack)

[HomeScan](https://github.com/8bitcommit/Home_Network) displays the devices on our home network and exposes their origins.

[P2P Chat](https://github.com/8bitcommit/TI1350_P2P_Chat-embedded_sys) implements a peer-to-peer (P2P) wireless chat and data storage system using the TI CC1350 microcontroller and PicOS. Each device operates as an independent node capable of discovering nearby nodes in the same group, storing and retrieving short messages, and communicating wirelessly in a decentralized, distributed network.

[PeaceKeeper Bot](https://github.com/8bitcommit/Robotics) is an autonomous, Nerf-firing UGV designed to detect, track, and engage red balloon targets using basic sensors, OpenCV, and a Raspberry Pi + Arduino combo.
