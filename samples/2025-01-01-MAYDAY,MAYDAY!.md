May 1st--May Day--started as a rallying cry for workers' rights. A day rooted in defiance, solidarity, and the demand for humane conditions. But in many modern corporate environments, particularly among upper and middle management, the radical edge of May Day has dulled to a LinkedIn platitude or been quietly ignored altogether.

Why? Because in upper management, job action--even mild dissent--is often seen as career-limiting behavior.

Let's be honest: the higher you climb, the more you're expected to toe the line. While frontline workers may still organize, strike, or walk out, middle and senior managers are trapped in a subtler bind: they are expected to sympathize with leadership while absorbing the frustrations of the rank and file. If they speak up--about burnout, inequity, impossible expectations--they risk being labeled not a team player, too emotional, or a culture mismatch.

In this tier of the corporate machine, you don't chain yourself to the factory gates; you learn to self-censor. To choose silence over friction. Dissent becomes an invisible sin with visible consequences: missed promotions, exclusion from key projects, and quiet exile from the "leadership pipeline."

It's ironic. These are the people best positioned to point out when a company's strategy is flawed, when morale is breaking down, or when values are being betrayed. But when management becomes a test of how much bullshit you can endure without blinking, May Day's call to collective conscience becomes a whisper you're afraid to echo.

So here's a radical thought for today: solidarity doesn't stop when you get a corner office. If anything, that's when it matters more. Real leadership means having the courage to speak up even when it costs you. Otherwise, you're not leading--you're just complying in a nicer suit.
’re not leading—you’re just complying in a nicer suit.
