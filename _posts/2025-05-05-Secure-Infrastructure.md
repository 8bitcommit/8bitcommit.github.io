As a Red Seal Journeyman Electrician and a graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science focused on System and Information Security, I've spent years with one hand on the code and the other on the conduit. In that space between the physical and the digital, I’ve seen something alarming:

We're building the future on insecure infrastructure.

## The Smart Grid is Dumb Without Security


From **Level 2 EV chargers** to **grid-tied solar inverters**, **battery banks**, and **smart panels**, modern electrical systems are no longer passive. They’re **active, networked, and hackable**.

Most of this equipment runs embedded Linux. Many have Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, and 4G radios. Some host their own web servers. Others ping out to cloud APIs across the globe. And yet, most electrical contractors installing this gear are given **no cybersecurity training whatsoever**.

That’s a disaster waiting to happen.

## What’s Actually at Risk?

This isn’t sci-fi. We’ve already seen:

- [**EV charger botnets**](https://www.pcmag.com/news/with-most-modern-cars-locked-down-hackers-turn-to-ev-chargers) used in DDoS attacks.
- **Photovoltaic inverters** being remotely accessed via default credentials.
- **Industrial battery banks** with open debug ports.
- **Public charging stations** with unencrypted OCPP traffic, vulnerable to spoofing and denial of service.

And it’s not just individual chargers or panels. It's **entire cities**. **Entire grids**. The infrastructure that powers our lives is being connected faster than it’s being secured.

## The Electrician’s Role is Changing

Traditionally, the electrician’s job was to **make it work** and **make it safe**. That hasn’t changed. But now, safety has a new dimension: **information safety**.

Installers are often the **only people** who physically touch these systems before they go online. That means:

- If you don’t change the default password, no one will.
- If you don’t notice the open port, no one will.
- If you don’t ask whether this thing phones home to China, no one else will.

## What Every Installer Should Be Doing

Here’s a starting point. If you’re installing connected EVSE, inverters, smart panels, or batteries:

- **Change the default credentials. Always.**
- **Update the firmware** before you leave the site.
- **Lock the enclosures**, and cover any USB, Ethernet, or debug ports.
- **Use secure Wi-Fi** or hardwired connections on a separate VLAN.
- **Label the gear clearly** and leave documentation for IT teams or end users.
- **Know the vendor’s cloud platform**. Understand where it connects, what it reports, and how it updates.

What may seem like paranoia is professionalism in 2025.

## Infrastructure is the Battleground

Cybersecurity isn’t just about laptops and firewalls anymore. It’s about **charging stations**, **streetlights**, **traffic systems**, **solar farms**, and **substations**.

The convergence of IT and OT (Operational Technology) means that a vulnerability in a $300 charger could be the pivot point into a corporate network. Or worse, into the grid.

We can’t afford to ignore this. Governments are waking up to it. Attackers already have.

## A Call to the Trades and the Geeks

To the electricians: start thinking like a hacker. Understand the systems you’re installing beyond the datasheet. Ask questions. Lock things down.

To the tech people: get your boots dirty. Learn how power flows. Understand the physical constraints, codes, and realities of the built environment.

Only together do we stand a chance of securing the infrastructure we’re racing to modernize.

*Got a project that needs to be both wired right and locked down tight? Reach out. Security doesn't stop at the panel.*
