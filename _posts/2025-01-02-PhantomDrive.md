## Summary

**PhantomDrive** is a USB-based, bootable Linux environment with automated VM support. Designed to operate in hostile or untrusted settings, it offers a secure, persistent OS (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) paired with lightweight virtual machines and privacy-first configurations. Whether you're a journalist, a traveler, or a hacker on the move, PhantomDrive provides a full computing experience that leaves no trace on the host machine.

## The Problem

Modern computing assumes trust. We plug into hotel charging stations, boot unfamiliar PCs, and surf on sketchy Wi-Fi. These environments pose serious risks—data theft, malware injection, or even hardware-level attacks.

When the U.S. Commerce Secretary’s laptop was allegedly cloned in Beijing in 2008, it wasn’t an edge case—it was a wake-up call. PhantomDrive answers that call.

## The Idea

Most live USBs suck. They're either too limited (no persistence), too bloated (full installs without security in mind), or too dependent on the host. PhantomDrive is none of those things.

Instead, it:

- Boots its **own OS**—no trace left behind.
- Uses **virtual machines** to isolate tasks.
- Stores data on an **exFAT partition** for cross-platform access.
- Features **scripted automation** for VMs and optional self-destruct tools.

## Implementation

Two drives. One mission.

- A 64GB USB: used to flash Ubuntu with Rufus.
- A 256GB USB 3.0: carved up with GParted into:
  - 1GB EFI (FAT32)
  - 35GB ext4 (OS)
  - the rest: exFAT (storage & VMs)

A suite of Bash scripts monitors for `.vbox` files, registers VMs with VirtualBox, and launches them using `VBoxManage`. Notifications? Handled via `zenity`. Automation? Clean and minimal.

VMs include:
- [**TailsOS**](https://tails.net/): for anonymous browsing via Tor.
- **Windows VM**: for familiarity and general use.
- **Linux Mint**: sandboxed, offline-only environment.

## Security Features

- **No reliance on host machine hardware**.
- **Ubuntu de-bloated**—media apps, email, calendars removed.
- **Kernel module blacklisting** (Bluetooth, webcam, SSH).
- **Optional self-destruct** scripts.
- **Compartmentalized VMs**: enforced user behavior.

## Lessons Learned

- **UEFI boot** is a nightmare until it isn’t—ESP flags and GRUB matter.
- **exFAT** is your friend when crossing OS borders.
- **Bash scripting** isn’t just automation—it's tiny infrastructure.
- **VirtualBox CLI** opens possibilities the GUI never shows.
- **USB 3.0 ≠ SSD**: performance tuning is essential, and tools like `neofetch` help.

## Looking Ahead

Future upgrades could include:

- **Storage encryption**
- **Login attempt logging**
- **YubiKey integration**
- **Per-VM hash checks for integrity**

PhantomDrive isn’t just a tool—it’s a framework for secure, portable computing.

## Conclusion

PhantomDrive proved that with the right design, you don’t need a trusted machine to work securely. It turned a simple USB stick into a resilient platform for privacy-first operations. It taught me that good security is less about bells and whistles—and more about smart, enforceable constraints.

> _“Build, break, fix, repeat.”_ That’s where real security begins.
