# Canada’s Electoral System: Representation For All

### Abstract

There has been much discussion of electoral reform in Canada in recent years. When presented with the arguments, it remains clear that major changes are required to ensure fair, democratic results that improve voter accessibility and representation of First Nations and other underrepresented Canadians in government. I argue the current electoral system, largely considered a two-party system, has allowed important issues to be ignored for too long and must not only be reformed but replaced entirely to ensure a fair, democratic outcome. I explain alternative electoral systems that have been implemented in other democratic nations and other suggestions that should be implemented to improve democracy and increase voter representation.

### Introduction

Canada’s single member plurality (SMP) voting system, commonly known as “first past the post” (FPTP), elects a single representative in each of its 338 electoral districts (Barnes et al., 2016). These districts or “ridings” are determined by a formula based on population size as detailed in section 51 of the Constitution Act of 1867 (Bodet et al., 2024). Using FPTP, the candidate with the most votes is elected to represent the riding in the legislature and the leader of the party that has been elected in the most ridings becomes Prime Minister and forms government (Barnes et al., 2016).

While the current FPTP system has some advantages — such as simplicity, fast results reporting, accountability, and perceived productivity — many have called for change. Notably, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised in his 2015 election campaign that the current election would be the last federal election using the SMP system (Mintz et al., 2021). Although this promise was broken, there remains a need and want for change.

Often, critics call for more proportional representation — a more accurate translation of votes to seats in Canada’s House of Commons. As it stands, there are a multitude of options that can provide more representative leadership for Canadians.

### Advantages of SMP

Canada’s current voting system is steeped in tradition and appreciated as a straightforward process. As former Chief Electoral Officer Jean-Pierre Kingsley told the Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016), “Nothing will be viewed as being as simple as the present system, because we’ve been at it for 149 years… This is part of the DNA of being Canadian and being born Canadian” (p. 47).

The FPTP system also allows Canadians to declare a new Prime Minister on election day. Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand commented to the committee that “Canadians are accustomed to learning the results of elections quickly and any possible delay should be considered carefully by the committee” (p. 48).

Although seemingly continued for mere tradition or a lack of political will, Bodel et al. (2024) noted that the single member districts of SMP also provide constituents with accountability from elected officials. In terms of productivity, Barnes et al. (2016) explained that FPTP “favours the installation of majority governments able to carry out a legislative agenda.”

In their article *Electoral reform could bring unintended results*, Clemens and Jackson (2014) note the difficulties coalition governments often have in achieving legislative results. They cite the research of Persson and Tabellini (2003) who determined that countries with proportional election rules spend 6% more than those using majority/plurality systems. They caution that increased spending translates to larger deficits.

### Issues With SMP

Despite arguments for the status quo, Bodel et al. (2024) gathered that the FPTP system is “Undemocratic, [by] reducing turnout among partisans of third parties and encouraging voters to vote tactically for their non-preferred party or candidate” (p. 217).

The Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016) referenced Jean-Pierre Derriennic’s book *A Better Electoral System For Canada* to demonstrate the distortions FPTP voting can present:

> On October 19, 2015, the Liberal Party received 54% of the MPs and 100% of the decision-making power in the House of Commons. It got 39.5% of the popular vote, but much of that vote went to defeated Liberal candidates... These Liberal MPs have 100% of the legislative power and support a government that has 100% of the executive power, despite being elected by only 17.9% of all Canadians of voting age (p. 51).

This allows a party with a false majority to govern as though they have a true majority. By using “omnibus bills,” the ruling party can push undebated legislation — not appearing in their platform — into law (Couture, 2014).

Political scientist Jean-Pierre Derriennic (2016a) explained that FPTP voting “exaggerates the conflicts that exist between the different regions of Canada” (p. 27). For example, under a Liberal majority, western provinces may lack representation entirely, especially where Conservative support is concentrated (Mintz et al., 2021).

Liz Couture (2014), National Councilor at Fair Vote Canada, argues that FPTP underrepresents small but significant parties. She pointed out that “almost one million Green Party supporters elected no representatives in the 2008 federal election, [while] an almost equal number of Bloc Quebecois voters... elected forty-nine members” (p. 7). This mismatch fosters a “democratic deficit” (Bodel et al., 2024, p. 218).

### Replacing the Current System

To improve Canadian democracy, electoral reform proposals have looked to other countries for solutions. A popular reform is the **ranked ballot** (or preferential ballot), which allows voters to rank candidates by preference. Used in Australia’s House of Representatives, this system encourages sincere voting and majority consensus (Mintz et al., 2021).

**Proportional Representation (PR)** systems — like those in Spain and Israel — aim for vote-to-seat alignment. For example, a party with 35% of the vote would get 35% of the seats. PR requires multi-member districts and may increase the total number of representatives.

**Mixed Member Proportional (MMP)** systems — like New Zealand’s — combine FPTP and PR to balance regional accountability with fairer national outcomes.

**Single Transferable Vote (STV)** — used for Australia’s Senate — blends ranked ballots with proportionality. It promotes candidate over party loyalty, encouraging voter focus on individual merit.

### Going Forward

Beyond voting systems, the Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016) proposed:
- Making election day a public holiday
- Voting on weekends or by mail
- Exploring online voting
- Considering mandatory voting or a lower voting age

Despite historical calls for reform, referendums have repeatedly failed. Often, a change in government kills the momentum (Jansen et al., 2016). York University political scientist Dennis Pilon observes, “our voting systems don’t have public input – they are crafted by those who want to keep or maintain power” (p. 13).

Still, the way forward remains clear. As the committee concluded:
> “Education, Education, Education.” (p. 143)
