# Canada’s Electoral System: Representation For All

### Abstract

There has been much discussion of electoral reform in Canada in recent years. When presented with the arguments, it remains clear that major changes are required to ensure fair, democratic results that improve voter accessibility and representation of First Nations and other underrepresented Canadians in government. I argue the current electoral system, largely considered a two-party system, has allowed important issues to be ignored for too long and must not only be reformed but replaced entirely to ensure a fair, democratic outcome. I explain alternative electoral systems that have been implemented in other democratic nations and other suggestions that should be implemented to improve democracy and increase voter representation.

### Introduction

Canada’s single member plurality (SMP) voting system, commonly known as “first past the post” (FPTP), elects a single representative in each of its 338 [currently 343] electoral districts (Barnes et al., 2016). These districts or “ridings” are determined by a formula based on population size as detailed in section 51 of the Constitution Act of 1867 (Bodel et al., 2024). Using FPTP, the candidate with the most votes is elected to represent the riding in the legislature and the leader of the party that has been elected in the most ridings becomes Prime Minister and forms government (Barnes et al., 2016).

While the current FPTP system has some advantages such as simplicity, fast results reporting, accountability, and perceived productivity and value for electorate, many have called for change. Notably, current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, promised in his 2015 election campaign that the current election would be the last federal election using the SMP system (Mintz et al., 2021). Although this promise was broken, there remains a need and want for change. Often, critics call for more proportional representation, meaning that there is a more accurate translation of votes to seats in Canada’s House of Commons. As it stands, there are a multitude of options that can provide more representative leadership for Canadians.

### Advantages of SMP

Canada’s current voting system is steeped in tradition and appreciated as a straightforward process. As former Chief Electoral Officer Jean-Pierre Kingsley told the Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016), “Nothing will be viewed as being as simple as the present system, because we’ve been at it for 149 years… This is part of the DNA of being Canadian and being born Canadian” (p. 47).

The FPTP system also allows Canadians to declare a new Prime Minister on election day. Chief Electoral Officer Marc Maynard commented to the Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016) that “Canadians are accustomed to learning the results of elections quickly and any possible delay should be considered carefully by the committee” (p. 48).

Although seemingly continued for mere tradition or a lack of political will, Bodel et al. (2024) noted that the single member districts of SMP also provide constituents with accountability from elected officials. That is, citizens have a representative in Canada’s parliament to address issues brought forward in their voting district.

In terms of having a productive government that provides value for the electorate, Barnes et al. (2016) explained that FPTP “favours the installation of majority governments able to carry out a legislative agenda”. In their article, *Electoral reform could bring unintended results*, Clemens and Jackson (2014) note the difficulties coalition governments often have in achieving legislative results. They cite the research of Persson and Tabellini (2003) who determined that countries with proportional election rules spend six percent more than those using majority/plurality systems. In their weariness of change, Jackson and Clemens also threaten that increased spending translates to larger deficits.

### Issues With SMP

Despite arguments for the status quo, Bodel et al. (2024) gathered that the FPTP system is “Undemocratic, [by] reducing turnout among partisans of third parties and encouraging voters to vote tactically for their non preferred party or candidate” (p. 217). In other words, the election outcome is distorted and may be leveraged by parties and voters who understand the shortcomings of the FPTP system.

The Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016) referenced Jean-Pierre Derriennic’s book, *A Better Electoral System For Canada* (2016b), to demonstrate the distortions FPTP voting can present:

> On October 19, 2015, the Liberal Party received 54% of the MPs and 100% of the decisionmaking power in the House of Commons. It got 39.5% of the popular vote, but much of that vote went to defeated Liberal candidates. Therefore, probably 39.5% of all Canadians are rather happy with the Liberal Party’s victory, but only 26.1% voted for one of the 184 elected Liberal candidates. Given a 31.5% abstention rate, these Liberal MPs have 100% of the legislative power and support a government that has 100% of the executive power, despite being elected by only 17.9% of all Canadians of voting age (p. 51).

This legislative power then allows a party with a false majority to govern as though they have a true majority. By using the method of “omnibus bills”, the ruling party can push undebated legislation, not appearing in the party’s original election platform, into law (Couture, 2014).

In addition to important policy being rejected or manipulated by the ruling party, the problem of regional disparities of representation in the FPTP electoral system becomes apparent. Political scientist Jean-Pierre Derriennic (2016a) explained that FPTP voting “exaggerates the conflicts that exist between the different regions of Canada, by preventing either the government majority or the opposition from having any representation in certain provinces” (p. 27).

To this point, Mintz et al. (2021) explains that the Conservative party has been more successful electing representatives in western provinces. Therefore, in the case of a Liberal majority, western provinces would lack electoral representation in the ruling party.

In another critique of the FPTP system, National Councilor at Fair Vote Canada, Liz Couture (2014), made the argument that a lack of proportional representation excludes parties with legitimate democratic concerns from government and tends to “severely underrepresent small but significant parties” (p. 1).

For example, The Green Party of Canada, known for having stringent environmental policy and novel approaches to human rights, poverty and healthcare policy, are often victims of FPTP’s lack of true voter representation (Mintz et al., 2021). As evidence, Couture (2014) provided the case that “almost one million Green Party supporters elected no representatives in the 2008 federal election, [while] an almost equal number of Bloc Quebecois voters in Quebec elected forty-nine members” (p. 7). Bodel et al. (2024) declared that “this mistranslation of votes-to-seats fosters a democratic deficit” (p. 218).

### Replacing the Current System

With the apparent faults of the FPTP system, committees have looked to other country’s voting systems to see which would best satisfy Canadians need for electoral reform.

According to Mintz et al. (2021), a popular reform has been majoritarian systems such as runoff elections or preferential ballot, also known as “ranked ballot”. They explain that runoff elections, used in countries such as France and Chile, include a second round of voting if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round. In the second round, only candidates that have received a specific proportion of votes are included on the ballot and must receive a majority of votes (Mintz et al., 2021).

According to Derriennic (2016a), in a ranked ballot system, voters rank candidates in order of preference. The candidate with the least votes is removed from consideration and the second choice of voters who voted for the disqualified candidate is counted. This continues until a candidate receives a majority of votes. The ranked ballot system is currently used to elect candidates in Australia’s House of Representatives (Mintz et al., 2021). I would agree with Derriennic (2016a) that ranked ballot is most favourable in that it encourages voters to educate themselves on the candidates and vote more sincerely.

Proportional representation (PR) systems are also popular and have been implemented successfully, with variations, in countries like Spain and Israel (Mintz et al., 2021). Mintz et al. (2021) explain that this system aims to have a similar percentage of votes to seats in the legislature. For example, if party A receives 35% of the votes, then their candidates hold 35% of the seats in parliament. In this system, voting districts can have multiple representatives, increasing the current number of seats in parliament.

A mixed member proportional system, currently used in New Zealand’s House of Representatives, combines features of SMP and PR to better reflect vote to seat ratios (Barnes et al., 2016).

A single transferable vote (STV) system, used to elect Australian senators, focuses on candidates over specific parties (Barnes et al., 2016). As explained by Mintz et al. (2021), STV is considered a combination of ranked ballot and PR where voters rank their preferred candidates. Once a candidate receives a certain portion of votes, that candidate is elected and any further votes for that candidate is transferred to the second-choice candidate on voters’ ballots until all seats are elected (Mintz et al., 2021). What sets STV apart from its counterparts is that it has multi-member districts which tend to incentivize voting for the preferred candidate rather than loyalty to one party (Mintz et al., 2021).

### Going Forward

Beyond electoral systems that provide better representation of the electorate, the Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016) discussed improving voter accessibility by means of making election day a public holiday, providing advance voting and voting on weekends, as well as the option of online and mail-in voting.

Mandatory voting and lowering the voting age were also presented as suggestions to improve representation. The committee found that while constitutional issues arose from implementing mandatory voting, this policy as well as lowering the voting age could prove beneficial in increasing voter turnout in youth and First Nations peoples.

Although calls for electoral reform continue, they have historically all met the same end in Canada. That is, public consultations and citizens assemblies lead to a failed referendum and a change in government tends to halt or delay the discussion once again (Jansen et al., 2016).

Sadly, as much as change is needed, Dennis Pilon, a political science professor at York University, laments “our voting systems don’t have public input – they are crafted by those who want to keep or maintain power” (Jansen et al., 2016, p. 13). While I recognize Pilon’s point as valid, I strongly believe the public needs to increase their knowledge of the democratic process. Ultimately, I agree with the conclusion of the Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016) that the path forward is “Education, Education, Education” (p. 143).
